Let's go ahead and get started on phase 1.

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you implement Phase 1 which focuses on basic connectivity. Let's break this down into steps:

1. First, we need to create and configure the selector in `__init__`
2. Then implement `setup_server_socket()` to handle incoming connections
3. Next, implement `connect_to_server()` for connecting to existing servers
4. Finally, implement the main event loop in `check_IO_devices_for_messages()`

Let's start with creating the selector in `__init__`:

```python
        # TODO: Create your selector and store it in self.sel
        self.sel = selectors.DefaultSelector()
```

Now let's implement the server socket setup:

```python
    def setup_server_socket(self):
        """ This function is responsible for setting up the server socket and registering it with your 
        selector.
        
        TODO: You need to create a TCP server socket and bind it to self.port (defined in __init__). Once the 
            socket has been created, register the socket with the selector created in __init__ and start 
            listening for incoming TCP connectionn requests.
        
        NOTE: Server sockets are read from, but never written to. This is important when registering the 
            socket with your selector
        NOTE: Later on, you will need to differentiate between the server socket (which accepts new 
            connections) and all other sockets that are passing messages back and forth between hosts. You can
            use what is stored in the data parameter that you provide when registering your socket with the  
            selector to accomplish this.
        
        Args:
            None
        Returns:
            None        
        """        
        self.print_info("Configuring the server socket...")

        # Create TCP server socket
        server_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
        server_socket.bind(('', self.port))
        server_socket.listen()
        
        # Make socket non-blocking and register with selector
        server_socket.setblocking(False)
        self.sel.register(server_socket, selectors.EVENT_READ, None)  # None data indicates this is the server socket
```

Now let's implement the connection to an existing server:

```python
    def connect_to_server(self):
        """ This function is responsible for connecting to a remote CRC server upon starting this server. Each
        new CRC Server (except for the first one) registers with an existing server on start up. That server 
        is its entry point into the existing CRC server network.
        
        TODO: Create a TCP socket and connect it to the remote server that exists at the following address:
            (self.connect_to_host_addr, self.connect_to_port)
        TODO: Register this socket with your selector. 
        TODO: Send a ServerRegistrationMessage to the server you just connected to. All initial server 
            registration messages MUST have their last_hop_id set to 0. Rebroadcasts of this message should 
            contain put the ID of the server that repeated the message in the last_hop_id field as normal.

        NOTE: Even though you know this is a server, it's best to use a BaseConnectionData object for the data
            parameter to be consistent with how other connections are added. That will get modified when you 
            get a registration message from the server you just connected to.

        Args:
            None
        Returns:
            None        
        """
        self.print_info("Connecting to remote server %s:%i..." % (self.connect_to_host, self.connect_to_port))

        # Create TCP socket and connect
        client_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
        client_socket.connect((self.connect_to_host_addr, self.connect_to_port))
        
        # Make socket non-blocking and register with selector
        client_socket.setblocking(False)
        connection_data = BaseConnectionData()
        self.sel.register(client_socket, selectors.EVENT_READ | selectors.EVENT_WRITE, connection_data)
        
        # Create and send server registration message
        reg_msg = ServerRegistrationMessage(self.id, 0, self.server_name, self.server_info)
        connection_data.write_buffer = reg_msg.bytes
```

Let me fix those linter errors. The issue is that we need to convert the registration message to bytes:

```python
    def connect_to_server(self):
        """ This function is responsible for connecting to a remote CRC server upon starting this server. Each
        new CRC Server (except for the first one) registers with an existing server on start up. That server 
        is its entry point into the existing CRC server network.
        
        TODO: Create a TCP socket and connect it to the remote server that exists at the following address:
            (self.connect_to_host_addr, self.connect_to_port)
        TODO: Register this socket with your selector. 
        TODO: Send a ServerRegistrationMessage to the server you just connected to. All initial server 
            registration messages MUST have their last_hop_id set to 0. Rebroadcasts of this message should 
            contain put the ID of the server that repeated the message in the last_hop_id field as normal.

        NOTE: Even though you know this is a server, it's best to use a BaseConnectionData object for the data
            parameter to be consistent with how other connections are added. That will get modified when you 
            get a registration message from the server you just connected to.

        Args:
            None
        Returns:
            None        
        """
        self.print_info("Connecting to remote server %s:%i..." % (self.connect_to_host, self.connect_to_port))

        # Create TCP socket and connect
        client_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
        client_socket.connect((self.connect_to_host_addr, self.connect_to_port))
        
        # Make socket non-blocking and register with selector
        client_socket.setblocking(False)
        connection_data = BaseConnectionData()
        self.sel.register(client_socket, selectors.EVENT_READ | selectors.EVENT_WRITE, connection_data)
        
        # Create and send server registration message
        reg_msg = ServerRegistrationMessage.from_args(self.id, 0, self.server_name, self.server_info)
        connection_data.write_buffer = reg_msg.to_bytes()
```

Let me check the ChatMessageParser.py file to see the correct way to create messages:

Now I can see that we need to use the static bytes() method. Let me fix the connect_to_server method:

```python
    def connect_to_server(self):
        """ This function is responsible for connecting to a remote CRC server upon starting this server. Each
        new CRC Server (except for the first one) registers with an existing server on start up. That server

        TODO: Create a TCP socket and connect it to the remote server that exists at the following address:

        TODO: Register this socket with your selector. 
        TODO: Send a ServerRegistrationMessage to the server you just connected to. All initial server 
            registration messages MUST have their last_hop_id set to 0. Rebroadcasts of this message should 
            contain put the ID of the server that repeated the message in the last_hop_id field as normal.

        NOTE: Even though you know this is a server, it's best to use a BaseConnectionData object for the data
            parameter to be consistent with how other connections are added. That will get modified when you 
            get a registration message from the server you just connected to.

        Args:
            None
        Returns:
            None        
        """
        self.print_info("Connecting to remote server %s:%i..." % (self.connect_to_host, self.connect_to_port))

        # Create TCP socket and connect
        client_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
        client_socket.connect((self.connect_to_host_addr, self.connect_to_port))
        
        # Make socket non-blocking and register with selector
        client_socket.setblocking(False)
        connection_data = BaseConnectionData()
        self.sel.register(client_socket, selectors.EVENT_READ | selectors.EVENT_WRITE, connection_data)
        
        # Create and send server registration message
        connection_data.write_buffer = ServerRegistrationMessage.bytes(self.id, 0, self.server_name, self.server_info)
```

Now let's implement the main event loop in check_IO_devices_for_messages:

```python
    def check_IO_devices_for_messages(self):
        """ This function manages the main loop responsible for processing input and output on all sockets 
        this server is connected to. This is accomplished in a nonblocking manner using the selector created 
        in __init__.
        
        TODO: Within the while loop, request a list of all sockets that are ready to perform a nonblocking 
            operation from the selector. Process those events based on the event type and the type of socket 
            (either a listening socket, a socket connected to a remote server, a socket connected to a remote 
            client, or a socket connected to an application whose type is not known yet).
        TODO: When processing READ events for this server's listening socket, call 
            self.accept_new_connection(io_device).
        TODO: When processing events associated with any other socket, call 
            self.handle_device_io_events(io_device, event_mask).
        TODO: Call self.cleanup() once the while loop terminates (i.e. the program needs to shut down)

        NOTE: All calls to select() MUST be inside the while loop. Select() is itself a blocking call and we 
            need to be able to terminate the server to test its functionality. The server may not be able to  
            shut down if calls to select() are made outside of the loop since those calls can block.
        NOTE: Pass a short timeout value into your select() call (e.g. 0.1 seconds) to prevent your code from 
            hanging when it is time to terminate it

        Args:
            None
        Returns:
            None        
        """
        self.print_info("Listening for new connections on port " + str(self.port))
        
        while not self.request_terminate:
            # Get list of ready sockets with timeout
            events = self.sel.select(timeout=0.1)
            
            for key, mask in events:
                if key.data is None:
                    # This is the server socket
                    self.accept_new_connection(key)
                else:
                    # This is a client/server connection socket
                    self.handle_io_device_events(key, mask)
                    
        # Clean up when terminating
        self.cleanup()
```

Now let's implement the accept_new_connection method:

```python
    def accept_new_connection(self, io_device):
        """ This function is responsible for handling new connection requests from other servers and from 
        clients. This function should be called from self.check_IO_devices_for_messages whenever the listening

        TODO: Accept the connection request and register it with your selector. All sockets registered here  
            should be registered for both READ and WRITE events. 

        NOTE: You don't know at this point whether new connection requests are comming from a new server or a  
            new client (you'll find that out when processing the registration message sent over the connected  
            socket). As such you don't know whether to use a ServerConncetionData or a ClientConnectionData  
            object when registering the socket with the selector. Instead, use a BaseConnectionData object so 
            you have access to a write_buffer. We'll replace this with the appropriate object later when 
            handling the registration message.

        Args:
            io_device (...): 
        Returns:
            None        
        """

        conn, addr = io_device.fileobj.accept()

        connection_data = BaseConnectionData()
        self.sel.register(conn, selectors.EVENT_READ | selectors.EVENT_WRITE, connection_data)
```

Finally, let's implement the handle_io_device_events method:

```python
    def handle_io_device_events(self, io_device, event_mask):
        """ This function is responsible for handling READ and WRITE events for a given IO device. Incomming  
        messages will be read and passed to the appropriate message handler here and the write buffer

            by the call to read() then the machine on the other side of the socket has closed their side of 
            the connection. You should unregister and close this socket if that happens.
        
        TODO: If this is a write event, check the write_buffer stored in the current io_device's associated 
            data object. If the write_buffer contains any data go ahead and write it to the socket and clear 
            the write buffer. You must check to see if the write_buffer contains any data as you don't want to
            send any empty messages. Similarly, you must clear the write buffer after sending because you 
            don't want to send any duplicate messages

        Returns:

        """

                if recv_data:
                    # We received data, handle it
                    self.handle_messages(io_device, recv_data)
                else:
                    # No data means connection was closed
                    self.sel.unregister(io_device.fileobj)
                    io_device.fileobj.close()
            except ConnectionError:
                # Handle connection errors
                self.sel.unregister(io_device.fileobj)
                io_device.fileobj.close()

        if event_mask & selectors.EVENT_WRITE:
            if io_device.data.write_buffer:

                try:
                    sent = io_device.fileobj.send(io_device.data.write_buffer)
                    # Clear the sent portion of the write buffer
                    io_device.data.write_buffer = io_device.data.write_buffer[sent:]
                except ConnectionError:
                    # Handle connection errors
                    self.sel.unregister(io_device.fileobj)
                    io_device.fileobj.close()
```

Let's also implement the cleanup method to properly close everything:

```python
    def cleanup(self):
        """ This function handles releasing all allocated resources associated with this server (i.e. our 
        selector and any sockets opened by this server).

        TODO: Shut down and unregister all sockets registered with the selector
        TODO: Shut down the selector

        NOTE: You can get a list of all sockets registered with the selector by accessing a hidden dictionary 
            of the selector: _fd_to_keys. You can extract a list of io_devices from this using the command: 
            list(self.sel._fd_to_key.values())

        Args:
            None
        Returns:
            None        
        """
        self.print_info("Cleaning up the server")
        
        # Get all registered sockets
        for key in list(self.sel._fd_to_key.values()):
            # Close the socket
            key.fileobj.close()
            # Unregister from selector

        # Close the selector
        self.sel.close()
```

Let me fix the linter error by using the proper selector API:

```python
    def cleanup(self):
        """ This function handles releasing all allocated resources associated with this server (i.e. our 
        selector and any sockets opened by this server).

        TODO: Shut down the selector

        NOTE: You can get a list of all sockets registered with the selector by accessing a hidden dictionary

        Args:

        Returns:
            None        
        """
        self.print_info("Cleaning up the server")

        for key in list(self.sel.get_map().values()):
            # Close the socket
            key.fileobj.close()
            # Unregister from selector
            self.sel.unregister(key.fileobj)
            
        # Close the selector
        self.sel.close()
```

Let me fix the cleanup method one more time to handle the sockets correctly:

```python
    def cleanup(self):
        """ This function handles releasing all allocated resources associated with this server (i.e. our 
        selector and any sockets opened by this server).

        Args:

        Returns:
            None        
        """
        self.print_info("Cleaning up the server")
        
        # Get all registered sockets and close them
        for fd in list(self.sel.get_map()):
            try:
                # Get the socket from the selector
                key = self.sel.get_key(fd)
                # Close the socket
                key.fileobj.close()
                # Unregister from selector
                self.sel.unregister(key.fileobj)
            except Exception:
                # Skip any sockets that have already been closed
                continue
            
        # Close the selector
        self.sel.close()
```

I've implemented all the core functionality for Phase 1. This includes:

1. Creating and configuring the selector in `__init__`
2. Setting up the server socket in `setup_server_socket()`
3. Implementing connection to existing servers in `connect_to_server()`
4. Implementing the main event loop in `check_IO_devices_for_messages()`
5. Handling new connections in `accept_new_connection()`
6. Managing I/O events in `handle_io_device_events()`
7. Cleaning up resources in `cleanup()`

The code should now be able to:
- Create a server socket and listen for connections
- Connect to an existing server and send registration messages
- Handle incoming connections from both servers and clients
- Process read/write events on all sockets non-blockingly
- Clean up resources properly when shutting down

There are some linter errors in the cleanup() method, but they appear to be false positives since we know the fileobj attribute of the selector key is a socket that has a close() method. The code should work correctly despite these warnings.

Would you like me to help you test this implementation or shall we move on to Phase 2?

**User**

Before moving on to phase 2, I would like to run the tests for phase 1

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you run the Phase 1 tests. Looking at the project structure, we can see there's a CRCTestManager.py file that handles testing. Let's examine the test configuration files for Phase 1:

I see that Phase 1 has three test cases:
1. 1_1_TwoConnections.cfg
2. 1_2_FourConnections.cfg
3. 1_3_EightConnections.cfg

Let's look at how to run the tests using CRCTestManager.py:

Great! I can see that we can run the Phase 1 tests by running CRCTestManager.py. The file is already configured to only run the Phase 1 tests (1_1, 1_2, and 1_3) since the other tests are commented out.

Let's run the tests:

Great news! All Phase 1 tests have passed:
1. 1_1_TwoConnections: PASSED
2. 1_2_FourConnections: PASSED
3. 1_3_EightConnections: PASSED

We earned 18 points out of the total 75 points available in the project (which makes sense since we've only completed Phase 1).

The tests show that our implementation successfully handles:
1. Setting up server sockets
2. Accepting incoming connections
3. Connecting to existing servers
4. Handling multiple simultaneous connections (up to 8 servers in test 1_3)
5. Proper cleanup of resources

Would you like to move on to implementing Phase 2, which involves handling server registration messages and building distributed state tracking?

**User**

Sure, we can move on to phase 2, but maybe help make it a little more hands on and explain what you're doing rather than just doing it all

---

**Cursor**

I'll help guide you through Phase 2 in a more interactive way. Let's start by understanding what Phase 2 requires.

Looking at the CRC_PROTOCOL.md file, Phase 2 focuses on handling Server Registration messages and building distributed state tracking. Let's break this down:

1. First, let's understand what a Server Registration Message looks like. From the protocol documentation:
```
0x00 - Server Registration Message
Fields:
  Message Type (byte = 0x00)
  Source ID (int) - Originating server's unique identifier
  Last Hop ID (int) - ID of server that forwarded this (0 for initial registration)
  Server Name Length (byte) - Length of server name string
  Server Info Length (half) - Length of server info string
  Server Name String (variable length, ASCII encoding)
  Server Info String (variable length, ASCII encoding)
```

The main method we need to implement is `handle_server_registration_message()`. This method needs to:
1. Check for duplicate IDs
2. Create ServerConnectionData objects
3. Update hosts_db and routing information
4. Forward registration messages to other servers

Let's start by looking at the current `handle_server_registration_message()` method:

```plaintext
0x00 - Server Registration Message
Fields:
  Message Type (byte = 0x00)
  Source ID (int) - Originating server's unique identifier
  Last Hop ID (int) - ID of server that forwarded this (0 for initial registration)
  Server Name Length (byte) - Length of server name string
  Server Info Length (half) - Length of server info string
  Server Name String (variable length, ASCII encoding)
  Server Info String (variable length, ASCII encoding)
```

Before we start implementing `handle_server_registration_message()`, we need to implement some helper methods first. Let's start with `send_message_to_host()` since we'll need this to send messages between servers.

Here's what `send_message_to_host()` needs to do:
1. Check if the destination ID exists in hosts_db
2. If it does, get the first_link_id from the host's connection data
3. Append the message to the write_buffer of the socket associated with that first_link_id

Would you like to try implementing `send_message_to_host()` first? I can guide you through it.

**User**

Yes, please guide me through it

I'll help guide you through implementing `send_message_to_host()`. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at what we know:
1. The method takes two parameters:
   - `destination_id`: The ID of the host we want to send to
   - `message`: The bytes of the message to send

2. We already have the check `if destination_id in self.hosts_db` in place

3. The `first_link_id` in each host's connection data tells us which adjacent server we should send through to reach that host. Think of it like "to get to host X, first send through server Y"

Here's what we need to do:
1. Get the host's connection data from `self.hosts_db`
2. Get the `first_link_id` from that connection data
3. Find the adjacent server's connection data (using the `first_link_id`)
4. Append the message to that server's write buffer

Would you like to try implementing this? Here's a hint to get started:
```python
def send_message_to_host(self, destination_id, message):
    if destination_id in self.hosts_db:
        self.print_info("Sending message to Host ID #%s \"%s\"" % (destination_id, message))
        # Get the connection data for the destination host
        dest_connection = self.hosts_db[destination_id]
        # What should we do next?
```

Try to think about:
1. How do we get from the destination's `first_link_id` to the actual server we need to send through?
2. Once we have the right server, how do we add the message to its write buffer?

Let me know if you want to try implementing it or if you'd like more hints!

```python
def send_message_to_host(self, destination_id, message):
    if destination_id in self.hosts_db:
        self.print_info("Sending message to Host ID #%s \"%s\"" % (destination_id, message))
        # Get the connection data for the destination host
        dest_connection = self.hosts_db[destination_id]
        # What should we do next?
```

---

**User**

I'm not quite sure, could you help me out

---

**Cursor**

Of course! Let's work through this together.

Looking at the code we have so far, we've got:
```python
def send_message_to_host(self, destination_id, message):
    if destination_id in self.hosts_db:
        self.print_info("Sending message to Host ID #%s \"%s\"" % (destination_id, message))
        dest_connection = self.hosts_db[destination_id]
```

Now, let's think about how messages get routed in this network:

1. When we want to send a message to a destination, we need to find the first server to send it through (stored in `first_link_id`)
2. The `first_link_id` is stored in the destination's connection data
3. We need to find the connection data for that first link server in our `hosts_db`
4. Then we can add our message to that server's write buffer

Here's how we can complete the implementation:

```python
def send_message_to_host(self, destination_id, message):
    if destination_id in self.hosts_db:
        self.print_info("Sending message to Host ID #%s \"%s\"" % (destination_id, message))
        # Get the connection data for the destination host
        dest_connection = self.hosts_db[destination_id]
        
        # Get the ID of the first server we need to send through
        first_link_id = dest_connection.first_link_id
        
        # Get that server's connection data
        first_link_connection = self.hosts_db[first_link_id]
        
        # Add our message to that server's write buffer
        first_link_connection.write_buffer += message
```

Let me explain each part:

1. `dest_connection = self.hosts_db[destination_id]` - Gets the connection data for our final destination

2. `first_link_id = dest_connection.first_link_id` - Gets the ID of the first server we need to send through. Think of this like "to get to server X, first send through server Y"

3. `first_link_connection = self.hosts_db[first_link_id]` - Gets the connection data for the first server we need to send through

4. `first_link_connection.write_buffer += message` - Adds our message to that server's write buffer. We use `+=` because there might already be other messages in the buffer waiting to be sent.

Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail? Or shall we implement this and move on to the next helper method?

```python
def send_message_to_host(self, destination_id, message):
    if destination_id in self.hosts_db:
        self.print_info("Sending message to Host ID #%s \"%s\"" % (destination_id, message))
        dest_connection = self.hosts_db[destination_id]
```

```python
def send_message_to_host(self, destination_id, message):
    if destination_id in self.hosts_db:
        self.print_info("Sending message to Host ID #%s \"%s\"" % (destination_id, message))
        # Get the connection data for the destination host
        dest_connection = self.hosts_db[destination_id]
        
        # Get the ID of the first server we need to send through
        first_link_id = dest_connection.first_link_id
        
        # Get that server's connection data
        first_link_connection = self.hosts_db[first_link_id]
        
        # Add our message to that server's write buffer
        first_link_connection.write_buffer += message
```

**User**

Let's keep going with phase 2

---

**Cursor**

Alright! Now that we have `send_message_to_host()` implemented, let's move on to implementing `broadcast_message_to_servers()`. This is another important helper method we'll need for Phase 2.

Looking at the method description:
1. We need to send a message to ALL adjacent servers (except for one we want to ignore)
2. We can use the `self.adjacent_server_ids` list that contains IDs of all directly connected servers
3. We need to skip any server whose ID matches `ignore_host_id`

Here's how we can implement it:

```python
def broadcast_message_to_servers(self, message, ignore_host_id=None):
    # Loop through all adjacent server IDs
    for server_id in self.adjacent_server_ids:
        # Skip the server we want to ignore (if any)
        if server_id != ignore_host_id:
            # Get the server's connection data and add message to its write buffer
            server_connection = self.hosts_db[server_id]
            server_connection.write_buffer += message
```

Let me explain what this does:
1. We loop through `self.adjacent_server_ids` which contains IDs of all servers directly connected to us
2. For each server, we check if it's NOT the one we want to ignore
3. If it's not ignored, we get its connection data from `hosts_db` and add the message to its write buffer

Now we can move on to the main part of Phase 2: implementing `handle_server_registration_message()`. This method needs to:

1. Check for duplicate IDs
2. Create a new `ServerConnectionData` object for the new server
3. Update routing information
4. Send existing network state to new servers
5. Broadcast the registration to other servers

Would you like me to explain how we should implement each of these steps? Or would you like to try implementing any part yourself first?

```python
def broadcast_message_to_servers(self, message, ignore_host_id=None):
    # Loop through all adjacent server IDs
    for server_id in self.adjacent_server_ids:
        # Skip the server we want to ignore (if any)
        if server_id != ignore_host_id:
            # Get the server's connection data and add message to its write buffer
            server_connection = self.hosts_db[server_id]
            server_connection.write_buffer += message
```

**User**

Please explain, because I am a little confused why we aren't implementing broadcast_message_to_adjacent_clients and send_message_to_unknown_io_device, so I'll follow your lead for now

---

**Cursor**

Let me explain our approach to Phase 2:

1. First, we implemented `send_message_to_host()` because it's a fundamental helper method that will be used by many other functions. It handles routing messages through the network by:
   - Finding the destination host in `hosts_db`
   - Getting the first server to send through (`first_link_id`)
   - Adding the message to that server's write buffer

2. We then started implementing `broadcast_message_to_servers()` because it's essential for server registration. When a new server joins, we need to:
   - Tell all other servers about the new server (using broadcast)
   - Tell the new server about all existing servers (using direct messages)

3. The reason we haven't implemented `broadcast_message_to_adjacent_clients()` and `send_message_to_unknown_io_device()` yet is that they're not immediately needed for Phase 2's core functionality. Here's why:

   - `broadcast_message_to_adjacent_clients()` is mainly used in Phase 3 when we start handling client connections and need to broadcast client-related messages
   
   - `send_message_to_unknown_io_device()` is used for error handling during registration (like duplicate IDs), but we should first implement the main registration logic in `handle_server_registration_message()`

Let's implement `handle_server_registration_message()` next, as it's the core of Phase 2. This function needs to:
1. Check for duplicate IDs
2. Create and store server connection data
3. Update adjacent server list if needed
4. Send existing network state to new servers
5. Broadcast the new server to the network

Would you like me to guide you through implementing `handle_server_registration_message()`?

**User**

Yes

**Cursor**

Great! Let's implement `handle_server_registration_message()` step by step.

1. First, let's check for duplicate IDs. If a server with this ID already exists, we need to send an error status message:

```python
def handle_server_registration_message(self, io_device, message):
    # Check if server ID already exists
    if message.source_id in self.hosts_db:
        # Create error status message for duplicate ID
        error_msg = StatusUpdateMessage.bytes(
            self.id,  # source_id (from this server)
            0,        # destination_id (0 since we don't know the new server's ID)
            0x02,     # status code for duplicate ID
            f"A machine has already registered with ID {message.source_id}"
        )
        # Send error to the unknown device
        self.send_message_to_unknown_io_device(io_device, error_msg)
        return
```

Let me explain this part:
- We check if the ID exists in `hosts_db`
- If it does, we create a status message with:
  - Code 0x02 (duplicate ID error)
  - Destination ID 0 (since we don't know the new server's ID)
  - A descriptive error message

Would you like me to continue with the next part where we create the ServerConnectionData and handle adjacent servers?

```python
def handle_server_registration_message(self, io_device, message):
    # Check if server ID already exists
    if message.source_id in self.hosts_db:
        # Create error status message for duplicate ID
        error_msg = StatusUpdateMessage.bytes(
            self.id,  # source_id (from this server)
            0,        # destination_id (0 since we don't know the new server's ID)
            0x02,     # status code for duplicate ID
            f"A machine has already registered with ID {message.source_id}"
        )
        # Send error to the unknown device
        self.send_message_to_unknown_io_device(io_device, error_msg)
        return
```

**User**

Sure, let's get through phase 2 and then I'll regroup for phase 3

---

**Cursor**

Let's continue implementing `handle_server_registration_message()`. We need to:

1. Set the `first_link_id` for the new server
2. Send existing network state to the new server
3. Broadcast the new server to the network

Here's how we'll modify the code:

```python
def handle_server_registration_message(self, io_device, message):
    # Check for duplicate ID (code we already wrote)
    if message.source_id in self.hosts_db:
        error_msg = StatusUpdateMessage.bytes(
            self.id, 0, 0x02,
            f"A machine has already registered with ID {message.source_id}"
        )
        self.send_message_to_unknown_io_device(io_device, error_msg)
        return

    # Create new server connection data
    new_server_connection = ServerConnectionData(
        message.source_id, 
        message.server_name, 
        message.server_info
    )

    # Determine if this is an adjacent server by checking if last_hop_id is 0
    # If last_hop_id is 0, this server connected directly to us
    is_adjacent = (message.last_hop_id == 0)
    
    if is_adjacent:
        # For adjacent servers, we are their first link
        new_server_connection.first_link_id = self.id
        # Add to adjacent servers list
        self.adjacent_server_ids.append(message.source_id)
        # Update the socket's associated data
        self.sel.modify(io_device.fileobj, 
                       selectors.EVENT_READ | selectors.EVENT_WRITE, 
                       new_server_connection)
    else:
        # For non-adjacent servers, their first link is whoever forwarded us this message
        new_server_connection.first_link_id = message.last_hop_id

    # Add the new server to our database
    self.hosts_db[message.source_id] = new_server_connection

    # If this is an adjacent server, send it information about all existing hosts
    if is_adjacent:
        for host_id, host_data in self.hosts_db.items():
            # Don't send info about the new server back to itself
            if host_id != message.source_id:
                if isinstance(host_data, ServerConnectionData):
                    # Create server registration message
                    reg_msg = ServerRegistrationMessage.bytes(
                        host_data.id,
                        self.id,  # we are forwarding, so we are the last hop
                        host_data.server_name,
                        host_data.server_info
                    )
                    new_server_connection.write_buffer += reg_msg
                elif isinstance(host_data, ClientConnectionData):
                    # Create client registration message
                    reg_msg = ClientRegistrationMessage.bytes(
                        host_data.id,
                        self.id,  # we are forwarding, so we are the last hop
                        host_data.client_name,
                        host_data.client_info
                    )
                    new_server_connection.write_buffer += reg_msg

    # Broadcast this new server to all other servers (except the one that just registered)
    broadcast_msg = ServerRegistrationMessage.bytes(
        message.source_id,
        self.id,  # we are forwarding, so we are the last hop
        message.server_name,
        message.server_info
    )
    self.broadcast_message_to_servers(broadcast_msg, ignore_host_id=message.source_id)
```

Let me explain the key parts:

1. We determine if a server is adjacent by checking if `last_hop_id` is 0 (means they connected directly to us)

2. For adjacent servers:
   - Set their `first_link_id` to our ID (we're their direct connection)
   - Add them to `adjacent_server_ids`
   - Update their socket's data with the new connection object

3. For non-adjacent servers:
   - Set their `first_link_id` to whoever forwarded us the message

4. If it's an adjacent server:
   - Send them info about all existing hosts (both servers and clients)
   - Use `isinstance()` to determine if each host is a server or client
   - Create appropriate registration messages

5. Finally:
   - Broadcast the new server to all other servers
   - Use `ignore_host_id` to prevent sending back to the new server

Would you like me to explain any part in more detail? Or shall we move on to testing Phase 2?

```python

        message.server_info
    )
    self.broadcast_message_to_servers(broadcast_msg, ignore_host_id=message.source_id)
```

Let's test phase 2

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you run the Phase 2 tests. Looking at the test files, Phase 2 has three test cases:
1. 2_1_TwoServers.cfg
2. 2_2_FourServers.cfg
3. 2_3_ElevenServers.cfg

Let's run the tests:

I notice that we're still only seeing Phase 1 tests passing. Let me check if we need to uncomment Phase 2 tests in CRCTestManager.py:

Yes, I see the issue. The Phase 2 tests are commented out. Let's uncomment them and run the tests again:

```python
# This batch of tests evaluates how your code handles Server Registration messages. 
        # In addition to the methods required for previous tests, you also need to complete the following method
        # to pass these tests: handle_server_registration_message().
        '2_1_TwoServers':7,
        '2_2_FourServers':6,
        '2_3_ElevenServers':5,
```

Now let's run the tests again to see if our Phase 2 implementation works:

I see the issue. Our Phase 2 tests are failing because we're not properly maintaining the `hosts_db` across the network. The main problems are:

1. When a new server joins, we're not properly sending it information about existing servers
2. When we receive information about a new server, we're not properly storing it in our `hosts_db`

Let me fix the `handle_server_registration_message()` method:

```python
    def handle_server_registration_message(self, io_device, message):
        # Check for duplicate ID
        if message.source_id in self.hosts_db:
            error_msg = StatusUpdateMessage.bytes(
                self.id, 0, 0x02,
                f"A machine has already registered with ID {message.source_id}"
            )
            self.send_message_to_unknown_io_device(io_device, error_msg)
            return

        # Create new server connection data
        new_server_connection = ServerConnectionData(
            message.source_id, 
            message.server_name, 
            message.server_info
        )

        # Determine if this is an adjacent server by checking if last_hop_id is 0
        # If last_hop_id is 0, this server connected directly to us
        is_adjacent = (message.last_hop_id == 0)
        
        if is_adjacent:
            # For adjacent servers, we are their first link
            new_server_connection.first_link_id = self.id
            # Add to adjacent servers list
            self.adjacent_server_ids.append(message.source_id)
            # Update the socket's associated data
            self.sel.modify(io_device.fileobj, 
                           selectors.EVENT_READ | selectors.EVENT_WRITE, 
                           new_server_connection)
        else:
            # For non-adjacent servers, their first link is whoever forwarded us this message
            new_server_connection.first_link_id = message.last_hop_id

        # Add the new server to our database
        self.hosts_db[message.source_id] = new_server_connection

        # If this is an adjacent server, send it information about all existing hosts
        if is_adjacent:
            # First, send our own registration
            reg_msg = ServerRegistrationMessage.bytes(
                self.id,
                0,  # we are the source, so last_hop is 0
                self.server_name,
                self.server_info
            )
            new_server_connection.write_buffer += reg_msg

            # Then send info about all other hosts
            for host_id, host_data in self.hosts_db.items():
                # Don't send info about the new server back to itself
                if host_id != message.source_id:
                    if isinstance(host_data, ServerConnectionData):
                        # Create server registration message
                        reg_msg = ServerRegistrationMessage.bytes(
                            host_data.id,
                            self.id,  # we are forwarding, so we are the last hop
                            host_data.server_name,
                            host_data.server_info
                        )
                        new_server_connection.write_buffer += reg_msg
                    elif isinstance(host_data, ClientConnectionData):
                        # Create client registration message
                        reg_msg = ClientRegistrationMessage.bytes(
                            host_data.id,
                            self.id,  # we are forwarding, so we are the last hop
                            host_data.client_name,
                            host_data.client_info
                        )
                        new_server_connection.write_buffer += reg_msg

        # Broadcast this new server to all other servers (except the one that just registered)
        broadcast_msg = ServerRegistrationMessage.bytes(
            message.source_id,
            self.id,  # we are forwarding, so we are the last hop
            message.server_name,
            message.server_info
        )
        self.broadcast_message_to_servers(broadcast_msg, ignore_host_id=message.source_id)
```

The key change I made was to send our own registration message to new adjacent servers. This was missing before, which is why servers weren't properly maintaining their `hosts_db`. When a new server connects:

1. We first send our own registration (with last_hop_id=0 since we're the source)
2. Then we send info about all other hosts we know about
3. Finally, we broadcast the new server to everyone else

Let's run the tests again to see if this fixes the issue:

I apologize for the terminal error. Let's try running the tests again:

---

**User**

It looks like phase 2 tests passed this time, but we can run them again if you'd like

---

**Cursor**

Actually, looking at the previous test output, Phase 2 tests were still failing. The main issue was that servers weren't properly maintaining their `hosts_db`. For example, in test 2_1_TwoServers:

```
2_1_TwoServers passed: False
rivendale: Wrong number of hosts_db (found 0, expected 1)
rivendale: Missing from hosts_db: [1]
```

This means when Rivendale connected to The Shire (ID 1), it didn't properly store The Shire in its `hosts_db`. 

Let's look at what's happening:

1. When Rivendale connects to The Shire:
   - Rivendale sends its registration message to The Shire
   - The Shire receives it and adds Rivendale to its `hosts_db`
   - The Shire should send its own registration back to Rivendale
   - But Rivendale isn't storing The Shire in its `hosts_db`

I think I see the issue. In `connect_to_server()`, when a server first connects, we need to create a ServerConnectionData for the server we're connecting to and add it to our `hosts_db`. Let me fix that:

```plaintext
2_1_TwoServers passed: False
rivendale: Wrong number of hosts_db (found 0, expected 1)
rivendale: Missing from hosts_db: [1]
```

```python
    def connect_to_server(self):
        """ This function is responsible for connecting to a remote CRC server upon starting this server. Each
        new CRC Server (except for the first one) registers with an existing server on start up. That server 
        is its entry point into the existing CRC server network.
        
        TODO: Create a TCP socket and connect it to the remote server that exists at the following address:
            (self.connect_to_host_addr, self.connect_to_port)
        TODO: Register this socket with your selector. 
        TODO: Send a ServerRegistrationMessage to the server you just connected to. All initial server 
            registration messages MUST have their last_hop_id set to 0. Rebroadcasts of this message should 
            contain put the ID of the server that repeated the message in the last_hop_id field as normal.

        NOTE: Even though you know this is a server, it's best to use a BaseConnectionData object for the data
            parameter to be consistent with how other connections are added. That will get modified when you 
            get a registration message from the server you just connected to.

        Args:
            None
        Returns:

        self.print_info("Connecting to remote server %s:%i..." % (self.connect_to_host, self.connect_to_port))

        # Create TCP socket and connect
        client_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
        client_socket.connect((self.connect_to_host_addr, self.connect_to_port))
        
        # Make socket non-blocking and register with selector
        client_socket.setblocking(False)
        connection_data = BaseConnectionData()
        self.sel.register(client_socket, selectors.EVENT_READ | selectors.EVENT_WRITE, connection_data)
        
        # Create and send server registration message
        reg_msg = ServerRegistrationMessage.bytes(self.id, 0, self.server_name, self.server_info)
        connection_data.write_buffer += reg_msg
        
        self.print_info("Connected to another server")
```

Let me also fix the `handle_server_registration_message` method to properly handle the first_link_id:

```python
    def handle_server_registration_message(self, io_device, message):
        # Check for duplicate ID
        if message.source_id in self.hosts_db:
            error_msg = StatusUpdateMessage.bytes(
                self.id, 0, 0x02,

            )
            self.send_message_to_unknown_io_device(io_device, error_msg)
            return

        # Create new server connection data
        new_server_connection = ServerConnectionData(
            message.source_id, 
            message.server_name, 
            message.server_info
        )

        # Determine if this is an adjacent server by checking if last_hop_id is 0
        # If last_hop_id is 0, this server connected directly to us
        is_adjacent = (message.last_hop_id == 0)
        
        if is_adjacent:
            # For adjacent servers, we are their first link
            new_server_connection.first_link_id = self.id
            # Add to adjacent servers list
            self.adjacent_server_ids.append(message.source_id)
            # Update the socket's associated data
            self.sel.modify(io_device.fileobj, 
                           selectors.EVENT_READ | selectors.EVENT_WRITE, 
                           new_server_connection)
        else:

                self.server_name,
                self.server_info
            )
            new_server_connection.write_buffer += reg_msg

            # Then send info about all other hosts
            for host_id, host_data in self.hosts_db.items():
                # Don't send info about the new server back to itself

                        reg_msg = ServerRegistrationMessage.bytes(
                            host_data.id,
                            self.id,  # we are forwarding, so we are the last hop
                            host_data.server_name,
                            host_data.server_info
                        )
                        new_server_connection.write_buffer += reg_msg
                    elif isinstance(host_data, ClientConnectionData):
                        # Create client registration message
                        reg_msg = ClientRegistrationMessage.bytes(

                            host_data.client_info
                        )
                        new_server_connection.write_buffer += reg_msg

        # Broadcast this new server to all other servers (except the one that just registered)
        broadcast_msg = ServerRegistrationMessage.bytes(
            message.source_id,
            self.id,  # we are forwarding, so we are the last hop

        )
        self.broadcast_message_to_servers(broadcast_msg, ignore_host_id=message.source_id)
```

Let me try one more fix. When a server receives a registration message from a non-adjacent server, we need to store the path to that server through the last_hop_id:

```python
    def handle_server_registration_message(self, io_device, message):
        # Check for duplicate ID
        if message.source_id in self.hosts_db:
            error_msg = StatusUpdateMessage.bytes(
                self.id, 0, 0x02,
                f"A machine has already registered with ID {message.source_id}"
            )
            self.send_message_to_unknown_io_device(io_device, error_msg)
            return

        # Create new server connection data
        new_server_connection = ServerConnectionData(
            message.source_id, 
            message.server_name, 
            message.server_info
        )

        # Determine if this is an adjacent server by checking if last_hop_id is 0
        # If last_hop_id is 0, this server connected directly to us
        is_adjacent = (message.last_hop_id == 0)
        
        if is_adjacent:
            # For adjacent servers, we are their first link
            new_server_connection.first_link_id = self.id
            # Add to adjacent servers list
            self.adjacent_server_ids.append(message.source_id)
            # Update the socket's associated data
            self.sel.modify(io_device.fileobj, 
                           selectors.EVENT_READ | selectors.EVENT_WRITE, 
                           new_server_connection)
        else:
            # For non-adjacent servers, we need to route through the last_hop_id
            new_server_connection.first_link_id = message.last_hop_id

        # Add the new server to our database
        self.hosts_db[message.source_id] = new_server_connection

        # If this is an adjacent server, send it information about all existing hosts
        if is_adjacent:
            # First, send our own registration
            reg_msg = ServerRegistrationMessage.bytes(
                self.id,
                0,  # we are the source, so last_hop is 0
                self.server_name,
                self.server_info
            )
            new_server_connection.write_buffer += reg_msg

Let's run the tests again to see if our changes fixed the Phase 2 issues:

Great news! All Phase 2 tests have passed:
1. 2_1_TwoServers: PASSED
2. 2_2_FourServers: PASSED
3. 2_3_ElevenServers: PASSED

We've earned 36 points out of 75 (18 from Phase 1 + 18 from Phase 2).

Would you like to move on to Phase 3? Phase 3 involves:
1. Handling client registration messages
2. Separating client/server broadcast logic
3. Sending welcome messages to new clients

I'll guide you through each step and explain what we're doing along the way. Let me know if you'd like to proceed!

**User**

I think I'll take a pause here, thanks for your help

---

**Cursor**

You're welcome! You've made great progress so far:

1. Successfully implemented Phase 1 (Basic Connectivity)
   - Set up server socket and selector
   - Implemented connection handling
   - Added proper cleanup

2. Completed Phase 2 (Server Network)
   - Implemented server registration
   - Built distributed state tracking
   - Added message forwarding between servers

When you're ready to continue, we'll work on Phase 3 which involves:
1. Handling client registration messages
2. Implementing client broadcast logic
3. Setting up welcome messages and status updates

Feel free to come back anytime you want to continue working on the project. I'll be here to help guide you through the remaining phases!
